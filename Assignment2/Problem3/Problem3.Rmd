This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Q3: Calculate the mean of sulfate across all of 332 monitors, ignoring any missing values coded as NA
```{r}
num <- seq (1, 332)

file_name_arr = sprintf("./specdata/%03d.csv", num) #test%d.csv", num)
#print (file_name_arr[1:10])

sum_sulfate <- 0
length      <- 0

for (i in 1:332) {
  data         <- read.csv(file_name_arr[i], header = T)
  attach(data)
  
  sum_sulfatei <- sum(sulfate, na.rm = T)
  lengthi      <- colSums(!is.na(data.frame (sulfate)))
  
  sum_sulfate  <- sum_sulfate + sum_sulfatei
  length       <- length + lengthi
}
print ( sum_sulfate / length)

```

```{r}
# Result: 3.189369
```

## Problem 4
```{r}
library(arulesViz)
data("Groceries")
#summary(Groceries)
inspect(Groceries[1:5])
```

```{r}
# The most frequent item: whole milk
# The length of the longest transaction: 2159
# The first five transactions:
# [1] {citrus fruit,semi-finished bread,margarine,ready soups}             
# [2] {tropical fruit,yogurt,coffee}                                       
# [3] {whole milk}                                                         
# [4] {pip fruit,yogurt,cream cheese ,meat spreads}                        
# [5] {other vegetables,whole milk,condensed milk,long life bakery product}
```

```{r}
rules <- apriori (Groceries, parameter = list (support=0.001, confidence=0.8))
#inspect(rules)
plot (rules)
```

```{r}
subrules <- head(sort(rules, by="lift"),3)
print (inspect (subrules))
```

```{r}
plot (subrules, method = "graph", control = list(type="items"))
```
