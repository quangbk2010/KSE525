This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data (wine, package="rattle.data")
df <- scale(wine[-1])
wssplot <- function(data, nc=15, seed=1234){
  wss <- (nrow(data)-1)*sum(apply(data,2,var))
  for (i in 2:nc) {
    set.seed(seed)
    wss[i] <- sum(kmeans(data, centers=i)$withinss)
  }
  plot(1:nc, wss, type="b", xlab="Number of Clusters",
  ylab="Within groups sum of squares")
}

```

```{r}
wssplot(df)
```
- wssplot function shows the relationship between the percentage of variance explained by the clusters against the number of clusters
- According to the result of executing this function, k = 3

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
(cl <- kmeans(df, 3, nstart = 25))
```
- #records belongs to cluster1: 62
- #records belongs to cluster2: 65
- #records belongs to cluster3: 51
```{r}
aggregate(wine[-1], by = list (cl$cluster), FUN = mean)
```

```{r}
library(cluster)
table (wine$Type, cl$cluster)
```
- There are 3 records of type 3 that are assigned to incorrect clusters

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
