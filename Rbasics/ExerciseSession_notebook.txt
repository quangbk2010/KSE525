## Association Rule Tutorial in R

- In this tutorial, we will learn how to:
    - Load data and essential libraries
    - Explore and understand data
    - Preprocess and transform data before analysis
    - Analyze data using association rules
    - Visualize data mining results
- After tutorial, we will perform project to be fully aware of association rules

## Package and Data

```{r}
# Load package
library(arules) # association rules
library(arulesViz) # data visualization of association rules
library(RColorBrewer) # color palettes for plots

# Load data
data(Groceries) # grocery transactions object from arules package
# Check loaded data
print(dim(Groceries)) # number of baskets and items in them
print(dim(Groceries)[1]) # 9835 market baskets for shopping trips
print(dim(Groceries)[2]) # 169 initial store items
```

## Plot Item Frequency 

```{r}
# Plot item frequency
itemFrequencyPlot(Groceries, support = 0.025, cex.names = 0.8, xlim = c(0,0.3), type = "relative", horiz = TRUE, col = "dark red", las = 1, xlab = paste("Proportion of Market Baskets Containing Item", "\n(Item Relative Frequency or Support)"))
```

## Explore Data

```{r}
print(head(itemInfo(Groceries))) 
print(levels(itemInfo(Groceries)[["level1"]]))  # 10 distinct levels
print(levels(itemInfo(Groceries)[["level2"]])) # 55 distinct levels
```

## Data Preprocessing

```{r}
# Aggregate items using the 55 level2 levels for food categories to create a more meaningful set of items
groceries <- aggregate(Groceries, itemInfo(Groceries)[["level2"]])
print(dim(groceries)[1]) # 9835 market baskets for shopping trips
print(dim(groceries)[2]) # 55 final store items(categories)
```

## Plot Item Frequency

```{r}
# Plot item frequency
itemFrequencyPlot(groceries, support = 0.025, cex.names = 1.0, xlim = c(0,0.5), type = "relative", horiz = TRUE, col = "blue", las = 1, xlab = paste("Proportion of Market Baskets Containing Item", "\n(Item Relative Frequency or Support)"))
```

## Mine Association Rules 

```{r}
# Obtain large set of association rules for items by category and all shoppers. This is done by setting very low criteria for support and confidence
first.rules <- apriori(groceries, parameter = list(support = 0.001, confidence = 0.05))
print(summary(first.rules)) # yields 69,921 rules

# Prune meaningless association rules using thresholds for support and confidence
second.rules <- apriori(groceries, parameter = list(support = 0.025, confidence = 0.05))
print(summary(second.rules)) # yields 344 rules
```

## Plot Association Rules

```{r}
# Data visualization of association rules in scatter plot
# arulesViz, RColorBrewer packages are used here
plot(second.rules, control=list(jitter = 2, col = rev(brewer.pal(9, "Greens")[4:9])), shading = "lift")
```

## Select Meaningful Rules

```{r}
# Select rules with vegetables in consequent (right-hand-side) item subsets
vegie.rules <- subset(second.rules, subset = rhs %pin% "vegetables")

# %pin% is the function which uses keyword to subset 
inspect(vegie.rules) # 41 rules

# Sort by lift and identify the top 10 rules
top.10.vegie.rules <- head(sort(vegie.rules, decreasing = TRUE, by = "lift"), 10)
inspect(top.10.vegie.rules)
plot(top.10.vegie.rules, method="graph", control=list(type="items"), shading = "lift")
```

## Project: Hard Drinks

- To see what people buy before hard drinks are purchased, we will do:
    - Load data and essential libraries(arules, arulesViz, RColorBrewer)
    - Make a new dataset 'groceries' aggregating item categories of Groceries itemsets into 55 categories; Level 1 has 10 categories, level 2 has 55 categories
    - Plot item frequency with support 0.001 using itemFrequencyPlot() function in 'blue' color 
    - Create association rules using Apriori() function with support 0.001 and confidence 0.05
    - Plot the association rules in 'Reds' color using plot() function
    - Extract transactions including hard drinks on the right side using subset() function; 'hard drinks' is one of 55 item categories in Groceries itemset level 2
    - Sort by the lift measure and print the top 5 association rules using head() function
    - Identify which item is included in all rules in the left side after listing all rules using inspect() function and explain whether it is important or not
    - Plot a graph of the top 5 rules using plot()
    - Analyze whether the derived 5 rules are important based on appropriate measures(lift, confidence, support) or other reasons
    
- Append a code chunk and text to include:
    - 3 plots
    - Common item category in the left side of top 5 association rules and explanation whether that category is important related to 'hard drinks' category
    - Association rule, support, confidence, lift measure, count value from the top 5 association rules
    - Reasons whether the top 5 association rules are important or not based on the measures or other reasons
